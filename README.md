## how to use 

### rabbitMQ in Docker 

#### install and run rabbitmq in docker 

* first of all , we need to set up rabbitMQ's image in docker , just simple run 

        docker pull rabbitmq:3-management
        
    or you can simple use ./build-image.sh
    
* secondly , we need to make a container for rabbitMQ in docker , i've make this done in docker-compose.yml

      rabbitmq:
        image: rabbitmq:3-management
        restart: always
        container_name: rabbitmq
        hostname: rabbitmq
        environment:
          RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER: "springcloud"
          RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS: "123456"
        ports:
          - "5672:5672"
          - "15672:15672"

    you can update the values of environment.
    
    plz pay attention , this is the simplest configuration. 
    
    I do not recommend using it in a production environment.
    
* when you build your images , simply run 

        docker-compose up -d 
    
    then you can go to your browser , and visit http://localhost:15672 to open rabbitMQ's web panel.
    
    the username is "springcloud" , and the password is "123456".    

#### config rabbitmq to make data saved

### examples 

* send a job queue and make it done in independent-worker

    * set job 
    
        open your browser , and visit : http://localhost:2333/demo-api-b/job/
        
        if it returns "success" , then you can find a job queue in rabbitMq's web pannel.
        
    * make job done 
    
        go to docker kitematic , and find independent-worker container's log , you can find a info : "job is done "
        
        this means independent-worker get the job from long-time-job queue , and make it done .
